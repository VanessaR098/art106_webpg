    <h1>Reading #2 | Natural Born Cyborgs Ch3 + 4</h1>

    <h2><b>Chapter 3</b> -- First summarize the major elements of this chapter for yourself and write them out in essay form. Specifically write 1 to 2 paragraphs of description using complete sentences. </h2>
    <h4>Q1. -- Related to the text descriptions of how our senses work with our brain, explain your experiences where your senses have momentarily misled you or someone you know.<br>
    Q2. -- What does the 'The Early Adopters Dream Technology' example on page 80 and the mangrove analogy starting on page 81 say about the role of language and its relationship to thought and meaning. Do you agree with the Author's assertions? Whether you agree or not, please explain why. <br>
    Q3 -- The Ideas of 'meta learning' (page 67) and constructive learning (page 83) are brought up in this chapter. What do these 2 ideas have in common in terms of the process of learning and using information and memory. Please elaborate your thoughts on how you can 'learn' something from this. <br>

  <h5>Summary</h5>
    <p>In Chapter 3, it discusses the highly negotiable state of our minds outside of our physical body. The mind is open to continual reconfiguration and mental alterations that allow for amplified neural experiences. With simple modifications, visual illusions, etc., our neural functions can transmit a feeling that goes beyond our body’s expectations. <br> The brain processes information in various ways, whether it’s from scratch or through learning acquired information.  However, the brain is continuously creating and exploring cognitive technology to expand human critical, analytical and creative thinking. We create cognitive systems of computational profiles that allow for our cyborg existence. This is done both through providing and being providing text and language, in which we create tools and outcomes that are as much a part of us as it is a product. </p>

  <h5>Question 1</h5>
    <p>There’s several examples I could share, mostly around the realm of illusions that our brain has trouble processing. I think the most common and most interesting is perspective illusions. One that is very common especially in the rise of its quite recent popularity are VR sets. When wearing a VR headset, I feel as if my visual perception is both enhanced and my neural responses are fooled into thinking I am actually living in an alternate reality. Ex. playing a VR zombie shooting game. Although I know they’re not real, the auditory and perceptual cues fool my brain into thinking they are about to attack and harm me. Another very similar illusionary feeling is the glass bridge tourist attraction that uses special effects to make the floor appear to be cracking from the people’s cumulative weight. This experience is quite similar to a VR set, except it’s not in an alternate reality. Instead, this simply enhances the already unconscious fear of being at high levels on a material (glass) that amplifies the significant incline. </p>


  <h5>Question 2</h5>
    <p>I agree with the author’s assertions made in ‘The Early Adopters Dream Technology’ as I, too, believe that technological advances and advances in technological consciousness, language, and interactivity truly is a double edged sword. We can access information, inspiration, strategies, etc. all at the touch of a button. However, that ease can cause laziness and desensitization if we already don’t have much of a purpose in our external lives. However, assuming one does have a purpose and knows their interests, the internet and technological development/devices really showcase the vast human intelligence that makes up the community of our world. It can be an amazing platform of inspiration and ‘popcorning’ of ideas. We can share, communicate, display our advanced language at ease to others in hopes that we can work together (without even knowing) to continue the incline of creative making. I believe the mangrove analogy is also a very good representation of showcasing the relationship language has to our thought processes. They are not separate, but rather they feed one another to build one another. Even as a child, when learning your parent’s language, our mind actively captures the input to create an output. Then, our output can create another conscious input for further critical thinking. </p>

  <h5>Question 3</h5>
    <p>On page 67, we’re told “meta-knowledge” is the “knowledge about how to acquire and exploit information, rather than basic knowledge about the world.” while on page 83, “constructive learning” is the system where “one whose own basic computational and representational resources alter and expand (or contract) as the system learns.” I believe the largest difference between these two learning methods is the interactivity and interpretation of the external world and awareness/unawareness of one’s mental capacity. However, in similarity, both undergo cognitive regulation. Meta learning can be cognitively regulated through planning and sequencing to promote critical thinking, while constructive learning requires regulation of their own cognitive structure to apply existing knowledge to current experiences. Another similarity is that both require self-reflection. One must think and monitor one’s thinking to build an understanding of information.</p>


    <h2><b>Chapter 4</b> -- First summarize the major elements of this chapter for yourself, and write them out in essay form. </h2>
    <h4>Q1. -- What are the 2 main components of action discussed in the book, that is required for Telepresence to exist and function properly?<br>
    Q2. -- What form of Telepresence do you think you have experienced? If you have not. What was the closest to it, and what was missing for it to not be telepresence?<br>
    Q3 -- Speculate on what other mechanics and sensory modalities that are based on Telepresence ideas, might be possible. What other ways can we be 'displaced' in their perception of where they are and what they can do.<br>
  </h4>

  <h5>Summary</h5>
    <p>In Chapter 4, it discusses the major elements of where we are as a biological organism in a reality of technological surroundings. The sense of our location and sense of our body can be modified through the generation of technology. However, this is only possible through interactive components. Our brains don’t work simply through relaying of information, but rather through acting upon and connecting with our worlds. This possibility of enhanced sensation is shown through several different experiences ranging from visual to physical encounters. We see this evidently through visual illusions, confusing our sense of perceptions and action. We also experience this through physical relocation of limbs, prosthetics, or even accessories that overtime throw our brain into a visage, as these “additions” become more and more transparent to our senses (virtually becoming forgettable). </p>

  <h5>Question 1</h5>
    <p>As discussed on page 93, the 2 main components required for functionality of Telepresence are (1) interactive components and (2) our perceptual inputs. </p>

  <h5>Question 2</h5>
    <p>A form of telepresence I think I’ve experienced is the manipulation of a drone. By using the camera-built in controller, I have visual control of where the device is going without having to physically be with it. In this case, I see it from the vantage point of the device and can thus interact with my environment through this external perspective, and my brain processes it as its own visual process. I believe this is a good example of telepresence so I don’t believe there was anything missing for it not to be considered a telepresence experience.</p>

  <h5>Question 3</h5>
    <p>Some other examples of telepresence would be in a medical field. Doctors could use endoscopy/pill cameras to be able to look deeper into a subject’s body from a different perspective and have the ability to interact within that environment quite freely. I’m also curious if the idea of telepresence could be applied to dreams? For example lucid dreaming, where there is a sense of control over the environment and you’re able to perceive this environment through a secondary conscious lense. Or what about out of body experiences? Could experience of hallucinations be considered telepresence?</p>
