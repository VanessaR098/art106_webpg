    <h1>Reading #1 | Natural Born Cyborgs Ch1 + 2</h1>


    <h2><b>Chapter 1</b> -- First summarize the major elements of this chapter for yourself and write them out in essay form. Specifically write 1 to 2 paragraphs of description using complete sentances.</h2>
    <h4>Q1. -- Summarize the distinction(s) from the traditional Klines &  Clines definition of the cyborg vs. the one that Clark is proposing as the main thesis of his book?<br>
    Q2. -- From The book, "Cyberneticists were especially interested in <i>self-regulating systems</i>." What are 2 or more example of these, make sure to include both biological systems and also non-biological systems. <br>
    Q3 -- What other kind of definitions of a hybrid humans are there that are not based on definations above but popular in literture, media culture, etc. <br>
  </h4>

  <h5>Summary</h5>
  <p>In Chapter 1, Clark discusses about the various definitions of the term cyborg and the component that make it up. He believes it is not the merging of flesh and wires that define it but rather the transformational potential of the subject. He begins with introducing our relationship with technologies and the seamless qualities it entails regardless of it not being embedded into ourselves. Clark believes that we are natural cyborgs and that we live in an illusion that our mind is separate from the rest of the world. He counteracts this by explaining his analysis of the seamless connections we have with our tools/devices.
</p>

  <h5>Question 1</h5>
  <p>Clynes and Kline's traditional definition of the term “cyborg” were actually in opposition to new developments causing humans to become something beyond human. Rather, they believed the term “cyborg” and to be a “cyborg” means to allow bodily enhancement but still keeping the mind intact to make its own choices. They believed the human should still be the vessel of these transformations. In comparison, Clark believes all humans are cyborgs in a natural form and don’t require technology to be associated as such.
</p>

  <h5>Question 2</h5>
  <p>An example of this as a biological system is, as mentioned in the reading, the human respiratory and circulatory system. When our bodily activity begins to rise and we need more oxygen to fuel and cool the body, “we breathe harder and our hearts beat faster” to allow more oxygen into the system. An example of this as a non-biological system is the flushing of any standard toilet. When we flush our toilers, the water flows out and triggers the valve to reset and reclose.
</p>

  <h5>Question 3</h5>
  <p>Some definitions of hybrid humans could be known as “crossbreeds” or “half-breeds”...I’m not sure if I’m answering this correctly but essentially mythological greek creatures, such as centaurs, pegasus, medusa, etc. Some other more traditional examples could be such as Robocop, Iron Man, Dr. Octopus.
</p>


<h2><b>Chapter 2</b> -- First summarize the major elements of this chapter for yourself , and write them out in essay form.</h2>
<h4>Q1. -- Summarize a definition as described in the book of what the significant attributes are for 'opaque' technology vs. 'transparent' technology.<br>
Q2. -- Give some examples of technology that might be better served if it were more transparent and and also give some example of a technology that should be more opaque. <br>
Q3 -- Does the watch and dictionary example discussed in the book, seem valid to you? Why? <br>
</h4>

<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>In Chapter 2, he begins to delve more deeply what type of technologies we do have a relationship with. Here he separates it as transparents vs opaque technologies and that this distinction is not always fixed and is rather dependent on the user’s versatility towards the tool. He defines opaque technologies to be not naturally integrated, but easily distinguishable from the user while transparent technologies are well fitted with our natural capabilities. He analyzes how naturally we've become accustomed to our tools, such as a watch, dictionary, etc. that he mentions and how it’s shaped our cognitive processes as its user.
</p>

<h5>Question 1</h5>
<p>As described in the book, typical and significant attributes of opaque technology are when we are aware of the tool and ourselves using that tool, such as our computers, a dishwasher, etc (I would add phones but I think that can be up for debate). In opposition, transparent technology is when we are so capable of using a tool as an extension of ourselves that it feels almost completely natural. We lose the awareness of recognizing it as a tool but rather see it as just a natural part of ourselves. Some examples could be a pen or pencil.
</p>

<h5>Question 2</h5>
<p>I will be honest, I’m not entirely sure I can think of anything because like implied in the book, this distinction between transparency and opaqueness is dependent on the tool and the user’s willingness to change themselves with this tool. I’m also unsure if I want anything to be completely transparent. I find there would be more harm than good morally but maybe I’m thinking about this too hard? If I’m just thinking about this from a learning type of experiences, possible learning An example of technology that I most certainly should be more opaque is our phones and social media. Although I know this doesn’t apply to everyone, I think a majority can relate to some level that our smartphone devices have become more and more transparent to ourselves the longer we live with them.
</p>

<h5>Question 3</h5>
<p>It most certainly does. I think Andy Clark’s analysis of this very relationship we have with technology is exactly a good way of describing our transparency with it. This also ties back into his initial idea of that relationship being seamless and natural to the point that we recognize it as a natural addition to ourselves. Even though it is not embedded in ourselves, we reach to it as if information the tools hold exists already in our memory capacity.
