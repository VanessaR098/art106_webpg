  <h1>Assignment #1 | Upgrade</h1>


  <h4>Q1. -- When you think of the term upgrade, do you think more of your brain being enhanced or your body? Which do you think you are more likely to personally invest the money and risks in?<br>
  Q2. -- Regarding the idea of enhancing technology that will be directly 'placed' onto or into ourselves, what do you see as the direction(s) humans are going to evolve in the future. What do you think will be the factors and mechanisms that drive this.<br>
  Q3 -- Would you prefer for technology to become more visible or invisible in our everyday experience. Should all of this be embedded in ourselves and our environment or would you prefer to see it, to touch it, for it to be more a part from you? <br>

<h5>Question 1</h5>
<p>	When I think of upgrade, I personally think more so about enhancements to my body. Sometimes its very easy to forget that enhancements can also take place to heighten brain activity/function and/or one’s senses. But universally, even in our games and movies, most enhancements are shown for aesthetics and thus we see them to be physical enhancements, rather than mental enhancements. If I were to invest in enhancements, I’d feel much safer investing in bodily enhancements since many of our limbs are not health/risk factors, if for whatever reason, a technological failure occurs and we lose an arm or a leg. Brain neurology on the other hand is very complex and minor damage can cause life changing consequences.

<h5>Question 2</h5>
<p>The question of how humans will evolve in the future is rather interesting because this brings to light whether or not evolution is still continuing? From a non technological standpoint, some may argue it’s being rather sidelined by humans because we have the ability to be very mobile. We no longer live in isolation so Darwin’s theory has no merit. The “weak” still live on and reproduce once maturing. But from a standpoint of technological advancement, genetic modifications may become our new “evolution.” We’ll be able to see widespread separation between the rich and poor and may begin to see an average in what is considered “attractiveness,” whether that’s physical or mental/emotional. This is where I start to believe it’s very plausible for us to all begin looking similar….and lack unique traits… I’m not sure how well I sit with that concept. This question also reminds me heavily of the movie Transcendence where the main character is able to create an immortal electronic presence of himself through AI. He transfers each atom of his mind to a computer where he can practically control everything, control operating systems, think faster, etc. I wonder if we’d ever become like this? Is it something we should be looking forward to? I’m not quite sure…
</p>

<h5>Question 3</h5>
<p>I believe whether its visible or not may just be a preference. Some may appreciate the privacy for themselves, some rather embrace the vulnerability and not be surprised or some may like the attention of their upgrade. Personally, I believe visibility would allow for people to show personality and vulnerability. I think it could also really bring together and embrace difference as we still struggle with that today. Some may find inspiration from these differences, whether it's for their courage of the aesthetic art of it.

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>In terms of functionality, I chose the features I did because I have very bad eyesight and horrible upper body strength due to my poor genetics and female stature. Therefore, the first modification I wanted mechnical eyes to improve my overall eyesight and enhance visual perception. I would also like robotic arms since my arms are very weak as a female. I can most certainly carry my own weight, but it's nothing in comparison to a male's ability. I'd like these robotic arms to allow ease when lifting heavy objects and avoid straining my wrists or even my back because of the pressure. An additional modification I'd lastly like is to enhance my nervous system, like that of Spider Man lol. I think it'd be beneficial in terms of sensing danger, especially when I walk alone with my lil dog. <br><br> Aesthetically, I would like to appear clean and minimal. I'd like my exterior modifications to be colored and made of black stainless steel. I think this combination is eyecatching, but not too attention grabbing which I feel fits my overall preferences. I'd like my robotic arms to have LED wiring on them so that I could have them light up just to look pleasing and cool at night. They could also act as a way of being seen at night and warm up my body to stay warm on cold evenings. Since my modifications will need some wiring to be functional, I'm not opposed to have my wiring embedded on the surface of my skin/flesh. However, I'd like to have it done to look intentional and thoughtful, as if I were to tell my tattoo artist how I'd like my tattoo. The wiring pattern will be of my choosing, probably something rather minimal and geometric to keep with the overall aesthetic.   </p>
