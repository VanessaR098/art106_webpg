  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <p>I thought it'd be really fun to emulate a part of one of my favorite childhood games growing up, Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen. I wanted to recreate the well known and loved Pokemon Center and the theme song associated with it. By doing this, I put my arduino board in a cardboard box that would be rather easy to decorate and have a foundation of a building-like structure. I decorated my box according to the look of the Pokemon Center (as shown in the games) and now I just had to make the software match the vibe. I took the Peter Gunn file provided by Steve and simply changed the already made arrays storing the wanted music notes. I took some piano sheet music I could find online of the Pokemon Center Theme song, read the notes of the melody, and simply added those notes to the array correspondingly. I, then, played around with the array storing the duration/tempo of each note to make sure the notes sounded similar, if not exact, to the tempo of the original melody.   </p>
