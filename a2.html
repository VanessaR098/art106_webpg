      <h5>Description</h5>
      <p>My reason for the placement of my LED Wearable is based off my anxiety. Most of the time when I'm anxious I tend to hold my hands together and either rub or tab my thumb on the top of my other hand. I do this as it passes time and distracts me, sometimes feeling like my act of comfort. So I thought, why not place my wearable here since I tend to do this very often to the point my parents and friends always point it out. I believe this is a much more common act than one may think, especially during times of, yes, anxiousness but also impatience. So whenever this act occurs, the LEDs will light up. </p>



      <h5>Challenges and Successes?</h5>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges of my LED Wearable circuit was that my purple LEDs seem to be of a higher amps compared to some other colors distributed to  the class. Even though all LEDs were advertised to  have the same amount of amps, myself and many others complained in the class that their circuits had issues even when following instructions exactly. Because of this predicament, I was not able to do a 3x2 circuit and it took me several hours to realize that the solution would be to reduce the amount of LEDs per resistor, hence why my circuit is now a 2x3. I came to this conclusion based off my Phase 2: LED Circuit Tests seeing how much brighter by 2x3 circuit in comparison to my 3x2. This solution worked out perfectly for me and many others in my class who had very similar problems :)  <br>  One of the greater successes was the wearing of the gadget. Although it isn't the most aesthetically pleasing or practical, it held up much better than I was ever expecting to.  </p>
